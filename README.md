# Multivariate-Logistic-Regression---Telecom-Churn-Prediction

Employed 21 customer behavior-related variables, encompassing statistics, services availed, and expenses, to develop a predictive model for a telecom firm. The primary objective is to forecast customer churn, indicating whether a customer will switch to another provider or stay. The binary 'Churn' variable (1 for churned, 0 for not churned) serves as the target variable. This model equips the telecom company with the capability to proactively identify potential churners, allowing them to implement retention strategies, enhance customer satisfaction, and optimize business profitability by reducing customer attrition.Model performance was assessed using a confusion matrix, ROC curve for threshold optimization, and key metrics including precision, recall, accuracy, and F1 score to ensure robust evaluation.
